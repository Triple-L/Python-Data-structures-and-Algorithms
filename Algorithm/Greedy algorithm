Today I encountered a question about array and Greedy algorithm.
This part of knowledge is quite unfamiliar with me now. So, I'd like to rewiew it from now.

1.Geedy algorithm is a kind of optimal algorithm, fearured with selecting the max result at each step.
However,in some situation greedy algoritm does not find the optimal solution once the array with a small number followed a bigger one.

If both of the properties below are true, a greedy algorithm can be used to solve the problem.

** Greedy choice property **: A global (overall) optimal solution can be reached by choosing the optimal choice at each step.
** Optimal substructure **: A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solutions to the sub-problems.
